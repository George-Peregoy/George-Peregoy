# Hi, I'm George

I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland, pursuing a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering. I have a strong interest in machine learning and its engineering applications.

## Skills
- Programming: Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), MATLAB, C++
- Machine Learning: Neural Networks (Feedforward, Autoencoders, Variational Autoencoders), Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting Machines & Random Forest
- Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, Hierarchical, DBSCAN, PCA, t-SNE, Isolation Forest)
- Engineering Tools: Fusion 360, Arduino IDE, SolidWorks

## Featured Projects
### Turbo Fan Remaining Useful Life Prediction
- Built a neural network with ReLU activations, MSE loss, Adam optimizer, and optional dropout to predict remaining useful life (RUL).
- Processed data with feature selection and normalization, achieving an 11.6% prediction margin of error.

### Solar Radiation Analysis
- Collected weather data via the OpenWeather API to calculate Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI) ratios for clear vs. cloudy conditions.
- Demonstrated ability to integrate APIs, handle real-world data, and extract actionable insights.
